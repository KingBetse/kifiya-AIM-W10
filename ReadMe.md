# Brent Oil Price Analysis

## Business Objective
The main goal of this analysis is to study how significant events affect Brent oil prices. We aim to understand the links between oil price changes and major occurrences such as political decisions, conflicts in oil-producing regions, global economic sanctions, and changes in OPEC policies. The insights gathered will assist investors, analysts, and policymakers in making informed decisions.

## Situational Overview
As a data scientist at **Birhan Energies**, a consultancy firm specializing in data-driven insights for the energy sector, you are tasked with analyzing the impact of political and economic events on Brent oil prices. This analysis is crucial for:

- Helping investors make informed decisions.
- Assisting policymakers in developing strategies for economic stability.
- Enabling energy companies to forecast prices and manage supply chains effectively.

## Data
The dataset contains historical Brent oil prices from May 20, 1987, to September 30, 2022, with the following fields:
- **Date**: The date of the recorded Brent oil price (formatted as ‘day-month-year’).
- **Price**: The price of Brent oil in USD per barrel on the corresponding date.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Define Data Analysis Workflow
- Outline steps for analyzing Brent oil prices.
- Understand data generation and compilation.
- Identify model inputs, parameters, and outputs.
- State assumptions and limitations.
- Determine communication channels for results.

### Task 2: Analyze Brent Oil Prices
- Build on time series analysis knowledge.
- Utilize advanced models (e.g., ARIMA, GARCH, VAR, LSTM).
- Explore economic indicators, technological changes, and political factors affecting oil prices.

### Task 3: Develop an Interactive Dashboard
- Create a dashboard using Flask (backend) and React (frontend) to visualize analysis results.
- Include features for filtering data, selecting date ranges, and displaying key indicators.

## Suggested Approach
1. **Data Collection**: Gather datasets on economic indicators and political factors from reliable sources (World Bank, IMF).
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identify patterns and relationships through visualizations.
4. **Model Building**: Develop multiple models for analysis.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Use performance metrics to assess models.
6. **Insight Generation**: Interpret model outputs to provide actionable insights.
